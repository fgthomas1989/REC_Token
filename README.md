## Renewable Energy Certificates Tokens - REC_Token

[Renewable Energy Certificates](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/renewable-energy-certificates-recs) (REC) are a market-based instrument that certifies the bearer owns one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable energy resource. The following link leads to a video by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), explaining REC's in more detail - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_12VYXms6-c&ab_channel=U.S.EnvironmentalProtectionAgency.

This project involves tokenizing REC's, which not only facilitates trading REC but also includes a claim function that accounts for energy already utilized. This group haphazardly selected a wind farm in Texas ([Astra Wind Farm](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/v1/qb.php?category=2611186&sdid=ELEC.PLANT.GEN.60856-WND-WT.M)) and used publicly available real monthly data to create our Beta version of the token.

## Future Considerations

As this was a two week group project, there are several features that the group would have liked to include but given the time constraints, was not able to. As such, following is a list of functions that would be implemented given more time;
